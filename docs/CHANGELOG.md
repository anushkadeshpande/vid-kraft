## Completed

### Initial Setup (Pre-existing)
- [0.0] - Project scaffolded with Electron + React + TypeScript + Vite (Pre-existing)
- [0.1] - Basic VideoPlayer component with canvas rendering (Pre-existing)
- [0.2] - Play/Pause/Stop controls (Pre-existing)
- [0.3] - Single file import and video resize handle on canvas (Pre-existing)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
- [1.1] - Defined core types in `src/core/types.ts`: Project, Track, Clip, MediaAsset, Annotation, Viewport, TimeRange, Transform, PlaybackState, SelectionState (2026-05-18)
- [1.2] - Set up FFmpeg integration: installed `fluent-ffmpeg` + `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg`, created `electron/ipc/ffmpeg.ts` (probe, thumbnail, export handlers) and `src/services/ffmpeg.ts` (renderer client) (2026-05-18)
- [1.3] - Set up Zustand state management in `src/store/projectStore.ts` with actions for tracks, clips, assets, annotations, playback, and selection (2026-05-18)
- [1.4] - Implemented Command pattern in `src/core/commands.ts` with `Command` interface, `CommandHistory` class (undo/redo stack), singleton instance (2026-05-18)
- [1.5] - Created operation registry in `src/core/registry.ts` — plugin system for self-registering operations (2026-05-18)
- [1.6] - Set up modular IPC architecture: `electron/ipc/` with ffmpeg + file handlers, updated main.ts to register handlers, updated preload with typed `window.api`, added type declarations (2026-05-18)

### Phase 2: Media Import & Management
- [2.1] - Multi-file import via `src/services/mediaImport.ts`: native file dialog, per-`MediaType` handler registry (classify/probe/thumbnail), `importFiles` skips invalid files per item; added `useMediaImport` hook and `app:getThumbnailDir` IPC handler (2026-06-27)
- [2.2] - Media Bin UI in `src/components/MediaBin/`: asset cards with thumbnail/name/type/duration/resolution, selection, per-asset removal, grid/list toggle; wired into `App.tsx` two-pane layout (2026-06-27)
- [2.3] - Thumbnail generation: video poster frame via FFmpeg, image self-thumbnail, audio placeholder; stored in OS `userData/thumbnails` (2026-06-27)

### Phase 3: Timeline & Tracks
- [3.1] - Timeline panel in `src/components/Timeline/`: scrollable time ruler with zoom (pixels-per-second), "nice" tick intervals, fixed track-header gutter; pure time↔pixel + `snap`/`snapClipStart` helpers in `src/core/timeline.ts` (2026-06-28)
- [3.2] - Track system: video/audio/overlay lanes with mute/lock/visibility controls and add/remove; media↔track compatibility registry and clip/track factories in `src/core/tracks.ts`; locked tracks reject edits (2026-06-28)
- [3.3] - Clip placement & drag-and-drop: drag assets from the Media Bin onto compatible lanes (HTML5 DnD) to create clips; reposition clips in time and move between compatible tracks via mouse drag with edge/playhead snapping (Shift disables snapping) (2026-06-28)
- [3.4] - Playhead & scrubbing: draggable playhead bound to playback `currentTime`, click-to-seek and drag-to-scrub on the ruler/lanes, current-time indicator in the toolbar (2026-06-28)
